# RemotePad
Control your computer from your Wii U!

Actually a beta, you can only send inputs.  

## How to build:  
Make sure you have devkitPPC + libogc + portlibs  
Run "make" inside the main directory  
  
The client uses unix and windows libraries so it will only compile in cygwin  
To compile it with cygwin cd to RemotePadClient and run "./build.sh"
